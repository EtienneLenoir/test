Let us begin by writing a VBA function that generates normally distributed
random numbers using the Box-Muller transform:
```vba
' Example VBA function to generate normally distributed random numbers
Function NormalRandom(mean As Double, stddev As Double) As Double
Dim u1 As Double, u2 As Double, z0 As Double
u1 = Rnd()
u2 = Rnd()
z0 = Sqr(-2 * Log(u1)) * Cos(2 * Application.WorksheetFunction.Pi() *
u2)
NormalRandom = z0 * stddev + mean
End Function
```


populates a range of cells with normally distributed random numbers:
```vba
Sub PopulateWithNormalRandom(rng As Range, mean As Double,
stddev As Double)
Dim cell As Range
For Each cell In rng
cell.Value = NormalRandom(mean, stddev)
Next cell
End Sub
```

VBA enables the seamless integration of these distributions into Excel
models. For instance, to simulate the expected losses from a credit
portfolio, we could use the Poisson distribution to model the number of
defaults:
```vba
Function PoissonRandom(lambda As Double) As Integer
Dim L As Double, p As Double, k As Integer
L = Exp(-lambda)
k = 0
p = 1
Do While p > L
k = k + 1
p = p * Rnd()
Loop
PoissonRandom = k - 1
End Function
```

Now, we'll construct a VBA subroutine that utilizes the Solver to find the
optimal asset weights:
```vba
Sub PortfolioOptimization()
' Define the range for asset weights, expected returns, and covariance
matrix

Visual representation facilitates a clearer understanding of the underlying
trends and patterns that might be obscured in tabular datasets. To illustrate,
let us extend the MACD example from the previous section by adding a
visual component that plots the MACD line, the Signal line, and the
Histogram:

2. Automate the Query Refresh with VBA:
```vba
Sub RefreshPowerQuery()
Dim wb As Workbook
Dim pq As WorkbookQuery
' Set the workbook
Set wb = ThisWorkbook
' Reference the Power Query by its name
Set pq = wb.Queries("YourQueryName")
' Refresh the query
pq.Refresh
End Sub
```

Step-by-Step Guide: Modifying Power Query M Code with VBA
1. Retrieve and Modify M Code:
```vba
Sub ModifyPowerQueryMCode()
Dim wb As Workbook
Dim pq As WorkbookQuery
Dim mCode As String
' Set the workbook
Set wb = ThisWorkbook
' Reference the Power Query by its name
Set pq = wb.Queries("YourQueryName")
' Retrieve the M code
mCode = pq.Formula
' Modify the M code as needed
' Example: Append a new step to the query
mCode = mCode & vbNewLine & "#""New Step"" =
Table.AddColumn(Source, ""NewColumn"", each 1)"
' Update the Power Query with modified M code
pq.Formula = mCode
' Refresh the query to apply changes
pq.Refresh
End Sub
```

2. VBA Code to Create a Dynamic Line Chart:
```vba
Sub CreateLineChart()
Dim ws As Worksheet
Dim chartObj As ChartObject
Dim lastRow As Long
' Set the worksheet reference
Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("SalesData")
' Get the last row with data
lastRow = ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
' Add a new chart
Set chartObj = ws.ChartObjects.Add(Left:=100, Width:=375, Top:=50,
Height:=225)
' Set chart type and data range
With chartObj.Chart
.ChartType = xlLine
.SetSourceData Source:=ws.Range("A1:B" & lastRow)
' Customize chart
.HasTitle = True
.ChartTitle.Text = "Monthly Sales Growth"
.Axes(xlCategory, xlPrimary).HasTitle = True
.Axes(xlCategory, xlPrimary).AxisTitle.Text = "Month"
.Axes(xlValue, xlPrimary).HasTitle = True
.Axes(xlValue, xlPrimary).AxisTitle.Text = "Sales"
End With
End Sub
```


2. VBA Code to Customize Bar Chart Colors:
```vba

Dim ws As Worksheet
Dim chartObj As ChartObject
Dim chartSeries As Series
Dim lastRow As Long
Dim i As Long
' Set the worksheet reference
Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("SalesData")

.Axes(xlCategory, xlPrimary).AxisTitle.Text = "Month"
.Axes(xlValue, xlPrimary).HasTitle = True
.Axes(xlValue, xlPrimary).AxisTitle.Text = "Sales"
' Loop through the series points to customize colors
Set chartSeries = .SeriesCollection(1)
For i = 1 To chartSeries.Points.Count
If ws.Cells(i + 1, 3).Value = "High" Then
chartSeries.Points(i).Format.Fill.ForeColor.RGB = RGB(0, 176, 80) ' Green
ElseIf ws.Cells(i + 1, 3).Value = "Medium" Then
chartSeries.Points(i).Format.Fill.ForeColor.RGB = RGB(255, 192, 0) '
Orange
Else
